						The haldi ceremony is the one in which a paste of haldi (turmeric) is applied on the Bride and the Groom’s body before their
						wedding. This ceremony is held at both the Bride and the Groom’s place, on the morning of the wedding day. The paste serves
						as a cleanser for the body and soul and signifies the Bride's and Groom's preparation and welcoming into married life.
