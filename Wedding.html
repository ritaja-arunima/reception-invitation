						The marriage day rituals begin with welcoming the Groom. The Bride's mother welcomes the Groom with the holy earthen lamp,
						sprinkling trefoil, and husked rice placed on a bamboo winnow (kula). As he enters the house, rose water is sprinkled over him.
						Then there is the Shubho Drishti ritual, wherein the Bride and the Groom see each other for the first time. This is followed by
						Mala Badal ceremony, wherein they exchange garlands. The most important ritual is the Saat Paak, during which the Bride is
						seated on a wooden plank and lifted by her brothers and she is taken around the Groom seven times, which signifies their union.
						Lastly in the Sampradhan ritual, Bride's father gives her away to the Groom.
