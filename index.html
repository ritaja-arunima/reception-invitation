								<h2>About Ritaja</h2>
								<p>Ritaja currently fuels the engineering team at Adnymics Munich. His work revolves around designing efficient
								software that predicts the likes and dislikes of customers to produce intelligent targeted advertisements. His love
								for artificial intelligence was sculpted into research skils for the industry at the Technical Universiy of Munich (TUM),
							  where he persued his masters in Computer Science. <br>
							  When he is not engineering, Ritaja can be found vaguely wandering the meadows, the shallows, the underrated overpasses
								and the less travelled soils of Europe with his camera tucked somewhere close-by. </p>
